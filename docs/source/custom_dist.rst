Custom distributions
=====================

Custom parametrization of ``scipy.stats`` distributions is available in Pykelihood
to align with statistical community standards. In a later version of Pykelihood,
we aim to include re-parametrization of a base distribution as a feature of
the ``Distribution` class. Custom distributions might thus be deprecated in the future.
