About
-----

Pikelihood is a Python package for statistical analysis designed to give more flexibility to likelihood-based inference, giving the possibility to:

- use **scipy.stats** as well as **R** distributions (through `RPy2 <https://rpy2.github.io/>`_),
- add trends of different forms in the parameters of any distribution,
- condition the likelihood with any form of penalisation,
- profile parameters with a penalised likelihood,
- fit joint distributions and point processes with self exciting or time dependent intensity
